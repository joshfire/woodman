Woodman features:

- **message levels** similar to those exposed by the `console` object (`log`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Through configuration, messages may be filtered based on their level.
- a **logger hierarchy** to keep track of the origin of messages and disable some of them based on their origin.
- **appenders** to change the destination where messages are sent without changing the code. Messages can be sent to multiple destinations at once. Examples of appenders include the `console`, a log file or a remote server using Web sockets. New appenders can easily be created.
- **layouts** to specify the format and structure of the messages sent to an appender: raw string, CSV, JSON, XML, whatever. New layouts can easily be created.
- **filters** to disable messages based on something else than their level or origin.
- a **removal tool** that drops all traces of Woodman from your code to create a shipping version of your app without logs. With Woodman, no more `console.log` in your production code!

What now? If that all sounds clear and great, [get started](getstarted.html) then check the [configure](config.html) section. If you're ready to dig into the code to fix a bug or implement a new Appender, Layout or Filter, take a look at the [Contribute](contribute.html) section. Last but not least, if you cannot help but wonder why Woodman exists at all, what it brings on top of the usual `console` and how it relates to other similar projects, check the [About](about.html) section.

Wherever applicable, Woodman follows the architecture, terminology and API of the [Apache Log4j 2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) project.
