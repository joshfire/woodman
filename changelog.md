## <a id="v0.9.0"></a>v0.9.0 - 14 November 2013

- Woodman throws a "woodman.Error" error when load fails ([#15](https://github.com/joshfire/woodman/issues/15))
- Woodman available as a Bower package ([#22](https://github.com/joshfire/woodman/issues/22), [#23](https://github.com/joshfire/woodman/issues/23)), thx @elskwid
- Precompiler supports unknown logger/woodman functions ([#f8edc9a54e](https://github.com/joshfire/woodman/commit/f8edc9a54e156807c3556c3bb66db71ec018a43e))

- `registerLevel` now creates corresponding trace functions on loggers ([#16](https://github.com/joshfire/woodman/issues/16)), meaning you can register the level `fatal` and start calling `logger.fatal` right away
